## Scripts included

in /useful/
  create-sinks-streaming.sh: A script to automatically create audiosinks to help with streaming
  git-pull.sh: Script to automatically pull all repos in $HOME/git (to exclude folder from being pulled, add an empty file called nopull to the folder)
  wallpaper-qtile.sh: Script to automatically change a file containing an image to change background on qtile
 
in /kinda-useless/
  delete-files.sh: Script allowing the user to delete files in their local directory, was made for fun and is less efficient than just deleting the files yourself
